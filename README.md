<h4>Problem in the Market</h4>
Ensuring a safe and secure environment, Indian parents are known for their extra possessiveness for their children. If the child is girl, their anxieties reach another level. They always want to make sure their child is safe and secure. We provide an atmosphere which gives satisfaction to the parents as we are well equipped with CCTV cameras, watchmen and security guards for big houses. PGs even make sure that they follow proper guidelines to ensure safety. In emergency, the PG also has access to doctors and first aid kits.
